      <p>I have passion in cooking various kinds of food. Fish-stew is just one of my delicious diet i have ever made.
        It is not an easy task hence worthy of appreciation. The origin of this recipe is Africa in Kenya. Most people at the lake
        and river areas are great fish eaters. There are many ways of preparing fish. However for the start, it is recommendeble to
        get used to one way before trying the next method. Be my guest as i make this delicious,most loved African fish-stew!!</p>
